Starting from https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis and clicking to the Music APIs I got to this list of Music related APIs: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#music

One that is interesting and we base this exercise on is TasteDive: https://tastedive.com/read/api

This exercise is: Create a webpage, that has a searchbox in which you can enter a music artist/band or a song name.
Then under it, after user presses search, you display similar artists: with name, description, and youtube link (if API returns youtube link)

Make this as a NodeJS project.

So to succesful complete the exercise you need to complete these stages/steps:

- Read about how to use the API here: https://tastedive.com/read/api and do some testing, with your browser
- create the html for the search box
- create the html for displaying the results
- after pressing search button -> create the page that displays the results
